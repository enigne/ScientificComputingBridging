    "9. The lab session for this course module contains an example concerning a diving board. In that application, the mathematical model after discretization is a system of linear equations where the coefficient matrix has a band structure. In addition, the matrix has further properties that make pivoting unnecessary. This is a very common situation in computer simulations. In such cases,the system of equations can be solved much faster if the band structure is taken advantage of. You should now investigate this in detail for the special case of a tridiagonal matrix A, assuming that pivoting is not required. An efficient implementation of Gaussian elimination for this case should make use of the fact that most of the elements in the lower triangle of A are already zero. Sketch a psuedo code for how to LU-factorize A when the tri-diagonal structure is taken into account. You can follow the lecture note or look up for the Thomas algorithm."
